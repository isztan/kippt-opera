# kippt-opera

To install the extension in Opera, drag the "kippt-opera.oex" file to your browser.

To build the extension, add the following files to a ZIP file:

config.xml
index.html
pop.html
kippt.png
kippt_big.png
includes/getinfo.js

Then change the extension of the file to .oex

NB. The extension will only play nice with pages that were loaded after the extension was activated.
To be sure all works as it should, restart Opera after installing.
